  "aboutText": "**Trust is at an all-time low**. Many blame AI, but I see it as a human-enhancer. It didn't create the problem, it amplified it.

Banks segment customers not from deep insight, but because no analyst can process millions of rows at once. AI can. **Combined with human intuition, unsupervised AI makes complexity accessible at scale**.\n\nI'm exploring the future of AI-enabled autonomous organizations, pushing toward *effectiveness* and *efficiency* where institutions fall short.

  "aboutTextFull": "We live in a time where trust is at an all-time low. Many mistakenly attribute this to Artificial Intelligence, but I see AI as a human-enhancer. It didn't create the problem, it amplified what was already there. And in doing so, it opened doors to opportunities we couldn't reach before.\n\nI've always seen UI/UX as the art of making complexity intuitive. Oral expression is our most complete form of communication. So what if complexity itself could be made conversational? *Voice AI is, to me, the next natural interface.*\n\nMost systems we use today are really just bridges between technology and human comprehension. Take banking, for example: customers are placed into categories and segments. I don't believe those segments came from a deep understanding of people, but rather from the limits of analysts who can't process millions of rows and columns at once. AI can. *I believe unsupervised AI, combined with human intuition, can unlock new potential: making complexity accessible at scale.* The unsupervised navigation of large datasets is only one piece of this puzzle.\n\nRight now, I'm exploring the future of AI-enabled autonomous organizations, and their path to true **effectiveness** and **efficiency**. That is something current institutions haven't yet achieved. My vision for the future of organizations is simple: *autonomous by default, human by exception, and decentralized by design*.",
